sublime-node-snippets
=====================

The majority of snippets for node 10.26. There are **783** total right now.

## Installing

#### Package Control

Just look for `sublime-node-snippets` on [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Node%20Completions). It is called "Node Completions" on the site, but comes up as "sublime-node-snippets".

#### Manual

* Open the Commands Palette (command+shift+p)
* Package Control: Add Repository
* Past in this repos URL
* Press Enter
* Open the palette again
* press enter on "sublime-node-snippets"
* watch it install

## Using

Pressing `.` (period) will end the snippet lookup.

You will have better results if you pretend the period isn't needed. So if you are looking for `fs.readdir`, you would type `fsread` and you would see the results coming up.

## Building

I went to each page of the node docs, and copied the functions. Then I wrote a converter to take each function and convert it to a snippet.

For Example, this line:

```
setTimeout(fun, delay)
```

Is going to get converted to:

```
setTimeout(${1:fun}, ${2:delay})${0}
```

When the word callback appears, it will convert it to the standard
`fun` snippet.

```javascript
fs.readdir(path, callback)
```

will become

```javascript
fs.readdir(${1:path}, function(${2:args}){
  ${3:// body}
})${0}
```

## sources.txt

This file is cool. It is just a line-by-line output of the node docs functions. This is the file that is raked over to generate the snippets.

## Running The Build

Just run `node build.js` and it will rake the sources.txt file and then write the new snippet in the snippets folder.

Everything before the first `(` will be used as the filename.

## Adding New Snippets

Here is how I quickly got all these snippets. I will use [Express](http://expressjs.com/3x/api.html) as an example since it isn't in here.

First I went to the docs for the framework, and I looked to see what the code examples were wrapped in.

For the [express](http://expressjs.com/3x/api.html) docs site, the codes are show in `section h3` tags. So to quickly get the list, I ran the following code:

```javascript
Array.prototype.slice.call(document.querySelectorAll("section h3"), 0).map(function(item){
  return item.textContent.trim();
}).join("\n");
```

Then copied the output and pasted it in the sources.txt file. Done!

**The word `callback` will automagically be converted into a function.**

## Contributing

Just add (or edit) a line in the source file. Then run `node build.js` to generate the new snippets.
